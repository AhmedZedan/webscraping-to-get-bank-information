# webscraping-to-get-bank-information

In this notebook i will apply webscraping on wikipedia to get a bank information.

This wikipedia webpage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks provides information about largest banks in the world by various parameters. We will scrape the data from the table 'By market capitalization' and store it in a JSON file.
